# My Learning Blog - Full Stack Setup Guide

This project is split into a **Frontend** (React/Vite) and a **Backend** (Node.js/Express).

## 1. Data Model Overview (Log)

The MongoDB schema (`server/models/Log.js`) contains the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `_id` | `ObjectId` | Unique identifier generated by MongoDB. |
| `title` | `String` | The title of the learning entry. Required. |
| `content` | `String` | The main body/notes of the entry. Required. |
| `tags` | `[String]` | An array of strings for categorizing entries (e.g., "React", "CSS"). |
| `date` | `Date` | The date of the learning event. Defaults to now. |
| `createdAt` | `Date` | Timestamp of creation (managed by Mongoose). |
| `updatedAt` | `Date` | Timestamp of last update (managed by Mongoose). |

## 2. Configuration & Running Guide

You need to run the Backend and Frontend in separate terminals.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- A running MongoDB instance (local or Atlas)

### Step 1: Backend Setup
1.  Navigate to the `server` folder (or move the server files to a separate `backend` directory).
2.  Initialize project and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm init -y
    npm install express mongoose cors dotenv
    ```
    *Note: Ensure `package.json` has `"type": "module"` to support the ESM syntax used in the code.*
3.  Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory:
    ```env
    PORT=5000
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/learning-blog
    ```
    *(Replace `MONGODB_URI` with your connection string if using MongoDB Atlas)*
4.  Start the server:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    *You should see: "🚀 Server running on port 5000" and "✅ Connected to MongoDB"*

### Step 2: Frontend Setup
1.  Navigate to the root directory.
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  Open your browser (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

The frontend is configured to look for the API at `http://localhost:5000/api/logs`.
